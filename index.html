        <p>Why</p>
          <p>when the impossible became realistic/rational/accomplishable..When Escape the Zoo went from trip montra to life philosophy...
              started out with something so bold(quit, jobs, tour the US, make content) and now it just seems logical
          </p>
          <p>We all yearn to "escape the zoo" (if the value we place on vacation days isnt proof enouhg) and
              we all achieve it in some way wether through meditaion, yoga, catching a sunset, playing music, taking a vacation, planting a garden
              or any other cherrished moment were we take pause, we remove ourselfs from expectation and become more home with ourself and the world
              around us.
          </p>
          <p>This may all sound a bit rituous, hey Dan and James get down off your high horse. But the truth is that it is
              simple, we are not re-inventing the wheele, there is nothing new here or noval. There is a passion in all of
              us to be lead by our own compass a desire for the "unkown" the "what if" We simpley hope to help make
              imposible seem more realistic, the what if's become why nots....what if your crazy adolecent view of
              the world isnt as crazy as you thought.
          </p>
          <p>thats why we encourage you to join in our story and share your own (no matter how small your ETZ moment is) share
              your moment of repreive from the madness and it will inspire others to remember their best moments and seek them more frequently

        Once you are able to do something out of desire and passion success is able to
        be meausred by much more then a payday...(shared experiances, a job well done blablabla)
