# Head Banner
  - Currently dead links 
    - Have them click through
  - Hover reveals more info or functionality
    - example: "Share your story" page should reveal a hashtag to share at or open a Wild Bands social account in another           page.
  - Add page/link to "Escape The Zoo"
    - have this banner be a video montage of "the zoo" (crazy city, cubical workplace, actual zoo, meetings etc). Fade to black with words "Escape The Zoo" (maybe fade back into some drone areal footy).
# Body 
  - Something other then product images for the cart
    - brainstorm: 
      + fun fact on a timer 
      + quick multiple choice interactive quiz revealing animal facts 
      + large graphics of animal prints - hover over to get animal name and fun/shocking fact
      + Have a choose your favorite print - Action: click print which then reveals what percent of site visitors chose the             same
